# UltrasoundAI: Bridging the Healthcare Gap for Pregnant Women

Welcome to the UltrasoundAI project! Our mission is to harness the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to address medical disparities faced by pregnant women in accessing high-quality ultrasound diagnostics. This README provides an overview of our project's goals, current status, and how you can contribute.

## Project Overview

**Goal**: UltrasoundAI aims to improve healthcare outcomes for pregnant women, particularly those in underserved communities. We believe that every expectant mother deserves access to accurate and timely ultrasound diagnostics, regardless of their geographical location or economic status.

**Approach**: Our approach involves the development of an AI-driven ultrasound analysis tool that can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing and monitoring pregnancy-related conditions. This tool is designed to be user-friendly, efficient, and cost-effective.

## Current Status

### Front End

The front-end development of UltrasoundAI is now complete. This means that we have a functional user interface where you can view examples of our database and see some blogposts talking about our research and our project goals.


We've strived to create an intuitive front-end experience to ensure that healthcare providers can easily adopt our system into their workflow.

Our one page UI does not need paginaton making it seamless when it comes to transitioning from Mobile to Desktop to Smartphone.

### Machine Learning (In Progress)

While the front end is ready for use, our machine learning component is a work in progress. The machine learning aspect involves training AI models to:

- Analyze ultrasound images for various pregnancy-related conditions.
- Provide instant and accurate diagnostic suggestions.
- Continuously learn and improve through user feedback.

Our team is actively working on refining these models, collecting and annotating data, and optimizing their performance. We are committed to delivering a robust and reliable AI system.

## How You Can Contribute

We believe that collaboration is key to achieving our goal of reducing medical disparities for pregnant women. Here's how you can contribute to the UltrasoundAI project:

- **Testing**: Help us test the front-end user interface. Provide feedback on its usability and report any issues you encounter.

- **Data Annotation**: If you have expertise in medical imaging, consider contributing by annotating ultrasound images to improve our machine learning models.
- -If you are a medical practicioner please contact: findagoodjob101@gmail.com

- **Machine Learning**: If you have experience in machine learning, join our efforts to develop and improve AI models for ultrasound analysis.

- **Documentation**: Contribute to the project's documentation, making it easier for others to understand and use UltrasoundAI.

- **Spread the Word**: Share this project with your network and let others know about our mission to bridge healthcare gaps.
